    <h3>Where I am from...</h3>
<p>My hometown is Nanchang City in Jiangxi Province of China, but many people do not know the place so I tell them I came from Shanghai since my dad works here.</p>
<p>My parents are both from Jiangxi Nanchang. However, since my dad works in Shanghai, and he has been working here for more than 20 years, sometimes I say I came from Shanghai instead of Nanchang.</p>
<p>I have an older brother Daniel who is four years older than me. His name is Daniel, or Minghao Deng.</p>
<p>ALthough I only have one brother, I have many cousins, and most of them from my dad's side are older than me. But the ones from my mom's side are all boys and younger than me.</p>
<p>I also have a dog, and her name is Mifan which translates to "rice" in Chinese. We adopted her last summer because she was dumped by her owner when she was a month old. She is eight months old now.</p>
