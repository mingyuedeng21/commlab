    <h3>I really like these...</h3>
    <p>I like to read books, especially historical fictions and mysteries.
      I don't have a favorite book, but some books I like are <br><i>The Book Thief</i> and <i>1984</i>.</p>
      <p>I like to listen to music, especially genres like Chinese pop music. I like Lay Zhang and GEM. I also like Show Lo and others.</p>
      <p>I like to watch Chinese TV shows and soap operas. I like many actors and actresses.</p>
      <p>I also like to watch movies, not only Hollywood but Chinese ones too. I don't have a favorite movie and I have already watched almost all the movies from the IMDB Top 250 List. And I really love <br><i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>.</p>
    <p>I sitll only like to eat Chinese food and I can't get used to eating American food like pizza or hamburgers. Besides the food, I'm both a tea person and a coffee person. My favorite tea is Chinese black tea and my favorite coffee is latte.</p>
    <p>My favorite sport is tennis. I've been playing tennis since I was eleven years old, and I was in the tennis team since then, but I don't play for competitions anymore.</p>
    <p>I often play tennis with my dad, and my mom would run to pick up the balls for us when we play.</p>
    <p>My brother does not like to play tennis, he likes to play badminton and basketball.</p>
