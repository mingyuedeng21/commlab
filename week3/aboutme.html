<h2>Hi, this is who I am...</h2>
<br>
    <p>I am a sophomore in MCC from New York campus.
      You can find more here at <br><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mingyue-deng-03b652163/">My LinkedIn Profile</a></p>
      <p>Although I moved to the United States when I was ten years old,
        my parents brought me up to learn about Chinese cultures and the country's history.</p>
      <p>  I learned to play zither and piano at the same time in order to continue to familiarize myself with both cultures through music.</p>
      <p>I like to write short stories in both English and Simplified Chinese.</p>
      <p>As a result, I write articles for the Generasian magazine in New York for the NYU New York campus in English, and I write articles for WeChat Group Account called Panopath. In fact, I am trying to start my own WeChat Group Account with my brother.</p>
      <p>Although I study MCC in New York, I am more familiar with CHinese Entertainment Industry than with the American one.</p>
      <p>Also, although I have lived in the United States for ten years, I am still more familiar with China and the way of living in China than the way of living in the United States. However, friends and my family describe me as thinking and acting like an American but with a Chinese heart.</p>
