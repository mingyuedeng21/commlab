  <h3>My Profle and Introduction</h3>
  <p>Welcome to my first comm lab page.</p>
  <p>I am a sophomore in MCC from New York campus. You can find more here at <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mingyue-deng-03b652163/">My Profile</a></p>
  <p>I like to read books, especially historical fictions and mysteries.</p>
  <p>I don't have a favorite book, but some books I like are <i>The Book Thief</i> and <i>1984</i>.</p>

  <p>I like to listen to music, especially genres like Chinese pop music.</p>
  <p>I also like to watch movies, not only Hollywood but Chinese ones too.</p>
  <p>I don't have a favorite movie and I have already watched almost all the movies from the IMDB Top 250 List.</p>
  <p>Although I moved to the United States when I was ten years old, my parents brought me up to learn about Chinese cultures and the country's history.</p>
  <p>I sitll only like to eat Chinese food and I can't get used to eating American food like pizza or hamburgers.</p>
  <p>Besides the food, I'm both a tea person and a coffee person. My favorite tea is Chinese black tea and my favorite coffee is latte.</p>

  <p>My hometown is Nanchang City in Jiangxi Province of China, but many people do not know the place so I tell them I came from Shanghai since my dad works here.</p>

  <p>I have an older brother Daniel who is four years older than me.</p>
  <p>I also have a dog, and her name is Mifan which translates to rice in Chinese. We adopted her last summer because she was dumped by her owner when she was a month old. She is eight months old now.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>ALthough I only have one brother, I have many cousins, and most of them from my dad's side are older than me. But the ones from my mom's side are all boys and younger than me.</p>
  <p>I've been playing tennis since I was eleven years old, and I was in the tennis team since then, but I don't play for competitions anymore.</p>
  <p>I often play tennis with my dad, and my mom would run to pick up the balls for us when we play.</p>
  <p>My brother does not like to play tennis, he likes to play badminton and basketball.</p>
