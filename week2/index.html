  <h2>Hello, Me!</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my first comm lab page.</p>
  I am a sophomore in MCC from New York campus. You can find more here at <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mingyue-deng-03b652163/">My Profile</a></p>
  <p>I like to read books, especially historical fictions and mysteries.</p>
  <p>I don't have a favorite book, but some books I like are <i>The Book Thief</i> and <i>1984</i>.</p>

<p>I like to listen to music, especially genres like Chinese pop music.</p>
<p>I also like to watch movies, not only Hollywood but Chinese ones too.</p>
<p>I don't have a favorite movie and I have already watched almost all the movies from the IMDB Top 250 List.</p>
<p>Although I moved to the United States when I was ten years old, my parents brought me up to learn about Chinese cultures and the country's history.</p>
<p>I sitll only like to eat Chinese food and I can't get used to eating American food like pizza or hamburgers.</p>
<p>Besides the food, I'm both a tea person and a coffee person. My favorite tea is Chinese black tea and my favorite coffee is latte.</p>

<p>My hometown is Nanchang City in Jiangxi Province of China, but many people do not know the place so I tell them I came from Shanghai since my dad works here.</p>
